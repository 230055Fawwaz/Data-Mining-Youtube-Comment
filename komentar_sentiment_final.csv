"We are allowing social media to turn us against one another. Don’t do it. It is making people crazy. Unite and and treasure are differences. My Mom always said, if we all like the same thing, there would not be enough to go around. Diversity contributes to innovation, but we have to draw the line when it comes to extreme behavior. Majority should always rule, because the majority is likely right. We should not change everything to cater to the one percent who want to identify as something different than what they are. We also need to get back to parenting our children rather than letting them go off in a tangent that is not good for them. Take them to church so they have someone to help them carry their burdens in this life. Our kids so many don’t have parents who parent and they have no relationship with God. This is why our kids are in such sad shape. They are either delinquent or mentally weak. I am not talking about all kids but about those that cause the problems particularly in our black communities. We all need to come together for the sake of the children and quit bickering about things that don’t really matter. Make sure your kids are in school and that the schools are teaching what will enable them to function in society. The problem is the parents and the school system and this is where the fix is. Congress just applies band-aides but the problem can only be fixed at the root. The root cause is people’s inability to parent and the failure of our school systems. Also, our children need a religious upbringing. It establishes a moral compass for them. I challenge everyone to unite in an endeavor to change this. Makes some freaking noise. Our black communities deserve better. Government assistance keeps them from striving for better.",@RJMCS101,2025-10-03T18:08:25Z,0,allowing social media turn one another dont making people crazy unite treasure differences mom always said like thing would enough around diversity contributes innovation draw line comes extreme behavior majority always rule majority likely right change everything cater one percent want identify something different also need get back parenting children rather letting tangent good take church someone help carry burdens life kids many dont parents parent relationship god kids sad shape either delinquent mentally weak talking kids cause problems particularly black communities need come together sake children quit bickering things dont really matter make sure kids school schools teaching enable function society problem parents school system fix congress applies band aides problem fixed root root cause peoples inability parent failure school systems also children need religious upbringing establishes moral compass challenge everyone unite endeavor change makes freaking noise black communities deserve better government assistance keeps striving better,-0.1757,Negatif

"Hard part for Mr. Jones is... Mr. Kirk's supporters hate you enough to kill you IN HIS NAME, on principle. You can't wipe the Black off. After the conversation, you're still gonna look like that. Y'all can agree, disagree, be civil or not. The racist argument has always been: ""There' s something wrong with being Black."" It is often presented in the context of criminal acts or decadent behavior. The retort from well-meaning Black people and sympathizers is therefore something like ""Well not all of us, not all Black people...,"" because you need to disown and isolate the ""bad ones."" Guess what, you can't fight racism with words. You can only fight racism with anti-racist actions. Begin by physically, mentally and emotionally embracing your race the same way your opponent does his. Chant this until you believe it: ""There is nothing wrong with being Black. There is nothing WRONG with BEING Black."" Every single dark-skinned, nappy-headed, criminal-minded, lazy, thievin' n-word, big-butted, bad mf is also included. All Black people EVER are who we are talking about. Do white people carve out an exclusive space for Charles Manson or murderous John Brown when they repeat the 14 words or practice their Christian Nationalism? No, they don't. Stop debasing yourself by allowing someone else to characterize you as inherently deficient. Argue about the things you can do something about: paying for mental health care; paying for public safety; raising kids who feel supported by and attached to their communities; who gets to read actual history books; how the US economy works (for some and against others).

What a nice way to defend inaction in face of intolerable suffering and abuse, under the guise of ""reasonableness"".

Meanwhile, people die in Gaza with the US's benediction against the entire world. The planet is burning by the endless fire of endless greed. People get all the hate in the world just for being brown or gay or trans etc. and the ones spreading that hate are the ones in power. Divide and conquer, that's all there is to it. A distraction to keep you off the real issues, and to form a front, dancing in their palms, against us. And you're all too blind and brainwashed to see it.

The people we disagree with couldn't give 2 shits about other's suffering, and just won't even try to listen. The only answers we get are lies and denial, ranging from fairly elaborate to painly obvious, just flooding the zone with bullshit.

I think what this past weekend's memorial showed was the spirit of forgiveness and prayer that is undeniably overtaking those who supported Charlie Kirk. The complete lack of violence and destruction in the aftermath of his assassination needs to be acknowledged by those talking heads on the Left. Not to illustrate that one side is superior, but to proclaim that This Is The Way Forward. We need to return to a place where the purpose of our discourse is to arrive at Truth, not to win a debate. 
Once upon a time, the left and the right agreed on the problems but disagreed on solutions. In the past almost two decades, we have stopped agreeing on the problems. That stupid word ""Hater"" which should never be used by a serious person has found it's way into the Halls of Congress. It has many synonyms, all meant to degrade the debater instead of addressing the position of the debater. 

Charlie's murder has broken my heart. It has also revived something in our country that I never thought possible, and that is people, Van Jones included, rehumanizing our political adversaries.

The only reason why we assume that “All Black and Brown people are criminals, Murderers, and Rapists” are because the media only focuses on these people to FEAR MONGER! To DEHUMANIZE, DEMONIZE US!

While the 2 Venezuelan men were killing the HISPANIC girl in Texas, that same week there were 2 other WHITE men killing a Hispanic 12 yr old girl last name Lopez also in Texas and another 11 yr old White girl in Florida. None of these made ANY NOISE. While Laken Riley was murdered, “862 reported femicide cases during the one-year period from July 2023 to June 2024.

I don't wanna hear one word about you ""just being a words guy"".  Just because you physically didn't get violent doesn't mean you're a good guy in this. Then at the end you say ""both sides are calling for murders"". You try to make it seem like it's even close to being even. Yes, of course, there are some people on the right that want an eye for an eye, but the claim it's even remotely even is insane.  You don't get to talk like you've been talking for the last several years and then come on here like you're the voice of reason. Your whole monologue at the end doesn't match what you've been doing for years now. It's you guys that have been calling for the censorship and almost all of the violence has been coming from the left for the last decade. This false equivalency is astounding.
