"We are allowing social media to turn us against one another. Don’t do it. It is making people crazy. Unite and and treasure are differences. My Mom always said, if we all like the same thing, there would not be enough to go around. Diversity contributes to innovation, but we have to draw the line when it comes to extreme behavior. Majority should always rule, because the majority is likely right. We should not change everything to cater to the one percent who want to identify as something different than what they are. We also need to get back to parenting our children rather than letting them go off in a tangent that is not good for them. Take them to church so they have someone to help them carry their burdens in this life. Our kids so many don’t have parents who parent and they have no relationship with God. This is why our kids are in such sad shape. They are either delinquent or mentally weak. I am not talking about all kids but about those that cause the problems particularly in our black communities. We all need to come together for the sake of the children and quit bickering about things that don’t really matter. Make sure your kids are in school and that the schools are teaching what will enable them to function in society. The problem is the parents and the school system and this is where the fix is. Congress just applies band-aides but the problem can only be fixed at the root. The root cause is people’s inability to parent and the failure of our school systems. Also, our children need a religious upbringing. It establishes a moral compass for them. I challenge everyone to unite in an endeavor to change this. Makes some freaking noise.

"Hard part for Mr. Jones is... Mr. Kirk's supporters hate you enough to kill you IN HIS NAME, on principle. You can't wipe the Black off. After the conversation, you're still gonna look like that. Y'all can agree, disagree, be civil or not. The racist argument has always been: ""There' s something wrong with being Black."" It is often presented in the context of criminal acts or decadent behavior. The retort from well-meaning Black people and sympathizers is therefore something like ""Well not all of us, not all Black people...,"" because you need to disown and isolate the ""bad ones."" Guess what, you can't fight racism with words. You can only fight racism with anti-racist actions. Begin by physically, mentally and emotionally embracing your race the same way your opponent does his. Chant this until you believe it: ""There is nothing wrong with being Black. There is nothing WRONG with BEING Black."" Every single dark-skinned, nappy-headed, criminal-minded, lazy, thievin' n-word, big-butted, bad mf is also included. All Black people EVER are who we are talking about. Do white people carve out an exclusive space for Charles Manson or murderous John Brown when they repeat the 14 words or practice their Christian Nationalism? No, they don't. Stop debasing yourself by allowing someone else to characterize you as inherently deficient. Argue about the things you can do something about: paying for mental health care; paying for public safety; raising kids who feel supported by and attached to their communities; who gets to read actual history books; how the US economy works (for some and against others). The amount of melanin in your skin is not a topic for debate.",@uncleedd6878,2025-10-02T18:57:58Z,0,hard part jones kirk supporters hate enough kill name principle wipe black conversation still gon look like agree disagree civil not racist argument always something wrong black often present context criminal act decadent behavior retort well mean black people sympathizers therefore something like well not not black people need disown isolate bad ones guess fight racism word fight racism anti racist action begin physically mentally emotionally embrace race way opponent chant believe nothing wrong black nothing wrong black every single dark skin nappy head criminal mind lazy thievin word big butt bad also include black people ever talk white people carve exclusive space charles manson murderous john brown repeat word practice christian nationalism stop debase allow someone else characterize inherently deficient argue things something pay mental health care pay public safety raise kid feel support attach communities get read actual history book economy work others amount melanin skin not topic debate

"""We need to be able to disagree agreeably, have a nice and civilised dialogue"". 

What a nice way to defend inaction in face of intolerable suffering and abuse, under the guise of ""reasonableness"".

Meanwhile, people die in Gaza with the US's benediction against the entire world. The planet is burning by the endless fire of endless greed. People get all the hate in the world just for being brown or gay or trans etc. and the ones spreading that hate are the ones in power. Divide and conquer, that's all there is to it. A distraction to keep you off the real issues, and to form a front, dancing in their palms, against us. And you're all too blind and brainwashed to see it.

The people we disagree with couldn't give 2 shits about other's suffering, and just won't even try to listen. The only answers we get are lies and denial, ranging from fairly elaborate to painly obvious, just flooding the zone with bullshit.

Dictatorships say ""shut up"", ""democracies"" say ""keep talking"". 
There's effectively no difference. ""Democraties"" are just oligarchies.

And that sad excuse of a wake when half the maga inner circle spoke and sold crap to make money off of a man's death. That says it all. They used him and he fell right into the hole. 

This should be proof for all you trumplicans. The rich don't give a flying F about you, me or the country. 
You have far more in common with the Democrats and indipendants than you care to admit. 
The rich are very effective at dividing us to fight amongst ourselves instead of focusing on the things that truly matter they'd have you up in arms over green M&Ms and kids books. 
Instead of thinking of how the rich has been screwing us all over for decades. How our water is becoming poisoned and undrinkable. How our air is causing illness.

And if he looked up the facts he would have seen that about 1 in 5 children in the US does not have enough food. That is 14 million children. 20% of all children. Yet Kirk called a young man dumb just for wanting to continue a program to make sure that kids were not hungry at school. That they could at least be sure to have a meal at school and did not have to learn on an empty stomach. Kirk vociferously and vehemently opposed this and personally insulted the young man who defended it. This is not ""respectful conversation."" And it is not a moral position.

"All credit to Van for making this public. He appears to be deeply moved, even shaken by this message from Charlie and his execution. I think what this past weekend's memorial showed was the spirit of forgiveness and prayer that is undeniably overtaking those who supported Charlie Kirk. The complete lack of violence and destruction in the aftermath of his assassination needs to be acknowledged by those talking heads on the Left. Not to illustrate that one side is superior, but to proclaim that This Is The Way Forward. We need to return to a place where the purpose of our discourse is to arrive at Truth, not to win a debate. 
Once upon a time, the left and the right agreed on the problems but disagreed on solutions. In the past almost two decades, we have stopped agreeing on the problems. That stupid word ""Hater"" which should never be used by a serious person has found it's way into the Halls of Congress. It has many synonyms, all meant to degrade the debater instead of addressing the position of the debater. 

Charlie's murder has broken my heart. It has also revived something in our country that I never thought possible, and that is people, Van Jones included, rehumanizing our political adversaries. That is a tremendous good brought forth from an evil act. It behooves is to foster and cultivate that spirit, considering it came at the cost of the life of a great and beloved man.",@pj9cos,2025-09-27T19:37:10Z,0,credit van make public appear deeply move even shake message charlie execution think past weekend memorial show spirit forgiveness prayer undeniably overtake support charlie kirk complete lack violence destruction aftermath assassination need acknowledge talk head leave not illustrate one side superior proclaim way forward need return place purpose discourse arrive truth not win debate upon time leave right agree problems disagree solutions past almost two decades stop agree problems stupid word hater never use serious person find way halls congress many synonyms mean degrade debater instead address position debater charlie murder break heart also revive something country never think possible people van jones include rehumanizing political adversaries tremendous good bring forth evil act behoove foster cultivate spirit consider come cost life great beloved man

"2 immigrants were assassinated too. They don’t even want to mention their names and NO ONE HAS GIVEN A FCK. BTW 2 WHITE MEN also slashed and killed 2 women on a bus the same time the Ukrainian girl did in Tulsa Oklahoma and again NO ONE GAVE A FCK.  Robert Rhodes and Jesse James Brown. LOOK IT UP! There was also a Hispanic woman randomly stabbed ALSO by a White man this week! HELLO!!! The only reason why we assume that “All Black and Brown people are criminals, Murderers, and Rapists” are because the media only focuses on these people to FEAR MONGER! To DEHUMANIZE, DEMONIZE US! Yet there are 20% more crimes committed by WHITE people than any other group in the USA (you are the majority duh) and they never seem to come out nationally and make a huge scene like the others do. While the 2 Venezuelan men were killing the HISPANIC girl in Texas, that same week there were 2 other WHITE men killing a Hispanic 12 yr old girl last name Lopez also in Texas and another 11 yr old White girl in Florida. None of these made ANY NOISE. While Laken Riley was murdered, “862 reported femicide cases during the one-year period from July 2023 to June 2024. These figures likely underestimate the true number.” IN THE USA. 

“Disproportionate impact on women of color: 

Women of color are disproportionately affected by femicide in the United States.

Black women are nearly three times as likely to be killed by an intimate partner compared to white women.

Indigenous women and girls are killed at a rate 6.4 times higher than their white counterparts.” 

By indigenous this also includes HISPANICS. - Called looking it up. 

Fyi in 5 years police have killed more than 2,600 Hispanics. That we KNOW about. Doesn’t include the ones we don’t like the 1,200 from Aligator Alcatraz.

You don't get to talk like you've been talking for the last several years and then come on here like you're the voice of reason. Your whole monologue at the end doesn't match what you've been doing for years now.

I understand what Van is saying. But I believe that civil dialogue and agreeably disagreeing shouldn’t make Kirk “an honorable person”. It should be the standard we expect from everyone. To say this is uniquely honorable shows just how low your expectations are of others. And the only reason Kirk wanted to debate public figures like Van is to increase clicks. He was just another fkn podcaster ffs.

"Hey Van: Newsflash---""words are weapons"".....When the Civil War spark off it was over slavery....Not just the act, the concept---but the idea-(put into words called laws) set slavery in motion over 400 years ago: And, then in a stunning twist four hundred years later---it was ""words again"" by Abraham Lincoln"".....Which launched the Civil War: Then after that war---Jim Crow---words once again set off the firestorm of retaliation and violence against blacks: Then Civil Rights--the pushback--that then again lead to calmness and almost forgiveness: then, discrimination---words that again set into motion racial hatred, apathy, resistance, misogyny and chasms of racial divide: Now when we are ""barely"" healing and reeling in from it all---along comes Trump and his republican acolytes in the shadows now in the limelight baking in the ebb and flow of racism.....Racism so blatant and bold hat it openly strips away our freedoms, rights and due processes-(again, those are words doing that)...So, when you ""debate"" with words---no Vance; they are weapons, words can be ""Weaponized"" and in that weaponization---Charlie Kirk was complicit, knowing, willing and even proud to engage in open racism and racist banter and make you think he's merely debating it's very merit, nature and stance....When in fact--he know all along that his ulterior motive was to recruit, influence and inspire a generation of young, vulnerable, impressionable whites to support his radical and racist / ideologies and falsehoods with the intention of resurging racism and inequality to a whole new modern level; and in doing so he also failed to see the counter-opposition that has and is still building in the ""wake"" of his racist madness and maddening: In short---he FA and then he Found Out!!!! I have no pity nor place in my heart and mind for a racist: Which is was Kirk was: A racist is a person that wants to destroy---not build: separate and dived not unite.....And, that is what we should be talking about and acknowledging here are racists that still lurk, move and act still from the shadows....

I’m sorry but “both sides are calling for civil war?” And maybe I’m wrong but the conservatives are not calling for that. What I’ve heard from most everyone is that we will continue to fight the way Charlie did. Through words. By carrying on his mission. If any so called conservative is calling for civil war I would say they’re in the minority and are not truly conservative and don’t represent us. Because the rest of us who are sane have said nothing about civil war.
